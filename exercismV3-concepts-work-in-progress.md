# List of concept exercises
Following concepts are organized in Pharo language specific manner. They don't use conventional approach of describing language aspects used from mainstream languages, it's more focused on specific and unique language properties. However, most of exercises can be somehow "mapped" to the conventional terms or explanation topics (e.g. iterating through collections can be mapped to "for", "do-while" terms).
